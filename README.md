# RandomOps - Pseudo-Random Numbers for C# and C

These are my old implementations of various Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) in the C# and C programming languages.


## C#

Algorithms:

- Ran2 from the book 'Numerical Recipes in C' by Press et al.
- Mersenne Twister by Matsumoto et al.
- KISS, XorShift, MWC256 and CMWC4096 algorithms by Marsaglia.
- Parallelized versions of MWC256 and CMWC4096.
- An interface to www.random.org for transparent retrieval of 'true' random bits through the internet.

## C

Algorithms:

- Ran2 from the book 'Numerical Recipes in C' by Press et al., but implemented from scratch here with a number of modifications.
